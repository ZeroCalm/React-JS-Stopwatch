<h2>This another small project I am working on to build my React JS skills</h2>


<h3>This is a simple stop-watch app</h3>


<p>In this exercise a timer appears on the screen and counts in seconds the amount of time user is on the page.
</p><br />
<p>I made use of the componentDidMount (as the component has already mounted) and the setInterval method should be called in this Life Cycle method</p>
